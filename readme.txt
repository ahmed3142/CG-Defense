Firstly,there has to be raylib setup in the computer to run our game. we have used a raylib starter template in our project which was found through GitHub. The link of that GitHub repository is attached here:

      https://github.com/educ8s/Raylib-CPP-Starter-Template-for-VSCODE

Secondly, some locations in our code have to be changed. They are:

1. " string filepath " in "textureloader.cpp" :  Here the location will be the path of 'Images' of 'assets' of 'src' file.
    
    Example :    "E:/1-2 Courses/Structured Programming LAB/projectDemo-ProjectDefense/src/assets/Images/"

2. " backgroundMusic " in "game.cpp" :   Here the location will be the path of " backgroundMusic.mp3 " of 'Audios' of 'assets' of 'src' file.

    Example :    "E:/1-2 Courses/Structured Programming LAB/projectDemo-ProjectDefense/src/assets/Audios/backgroundMusic.mp3"

3. " buttonHoverSound " in "game.cpp" :   Here the location will be the path of " buttonHover.wav " of 'Audios' of 'assets' of 'src' file.
    
    Example :    "E:/1-2 Courses/Structured Programming LAB/projectDemo-ProjectDefense/src/assets/Audios/buttonHover.wav"

4. " towerShootSound " in "game.cpp" :   Here the location will be the path of " shootingTower.mp3 " of 'Audios' of 'assets' of 'src' file.

    Example :     "E:/1-2 Courses/Structured Programming LAB/projectDemo-ProjectDefense/src/assets/Audios/shootingTower.mp3"

5. " cannonExplosionSound " in "game.cpp" :   Here the location will be the path of " cannonBlast.mp3 " of 'Audios' of 'assets' of 'src' file.

    Example :     "E:/1-2 Courses/Structured Programming LAB/projectDemo-ProjectDefense/src/assets/Audios/cannonBlast.mp3"

6. " buttonHoverSound " in "levelEditor.cpp" :   Here the location will be the path of " buttonHover.wav " of 'Audios' of 'assets' of 'src' file.
 
    Example :     "E:/1-2 Courses/Structured Programming LAB/projectDemo-ProjectDefense/src/assets/Audios/buttonHover.wav"


Aftering changing the locations, the game code will be prepared to build and run.
